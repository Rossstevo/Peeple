# What is it? 

A simple game where users guess a famous person based on squares being revealed. 

# Why is it called Birdle?

I initially wanted to make it for birds before realising the market was too small 

# What did you make it with?

I used Vanilla JS. I wanted to launch the game quickly so I used vanilla JS. React would hae been better but my React de-bugging is not as hot as my JS. This turned out to be a good decision because once the site went live, I needed to do a lot of quick de-bugging
I am hosting the site on Netlify. 

# How has it been received?

Better than expected. 

# What have I learned?

Loads. I've not coded to such pressure before. Knowing my code will be used and tested adds a sense of responsibility and de-bugging when the site is live is a real thrill. 

# failures?

Commits. When the pressure hits, I am not being specific enough with my commit messages.

# coolest feature?

The tile-reveal formular was a fun problem to solve and ended up being pretty simple. I made an array of variables [tiles14, tile7, tile22, tile 16, tile 1]. When the user clicks 'peep' the first item in teh array is used then discarded.
